            <p>  Growing up in the cornfields of Champaign County, Ohio, I always had a fascination with technology. 
                At a young age, I would always take apart electronics to see how they worked. 
                My first taste of programming was in the mid-90's when I was given an IBM AT PC after my cousin upgraded to a new laptop with the revolutionary Windows 3.1. 
                The computer had no games on it and the monitor was capable of producing one color, green. My friend and I discovered it had the BASIC programming 
                language installed and I taught myself how to make simple programs. It was after this, I decided I wanted to become a computer programmer and attended 
                DeVry University to major in Computer Information Systems. When I first attempted to learn Java, there was a lack of resources available and my professor was less than knowledgable in the subject matter.  
                This combination caused me frustration and lead me to a change my major to Business Information Systems and a career in restaurant management. During my time in restaurant management, 
                I still had a love for technology and how things worked. After years in the restaurant industry, I finally made the decision to make a career change and joined a top rated coding bootcamp, <a href="https://wecancodeit.org" target="_blank">We Can Code It</a>.</p>
                <br>
            <p> 
                    Now, I am full-stack Java developer!   
                    My original frustration with Java has now grown into a love of learning more about it. I am constantly researching and learning new technologies to make myself more valuable to any employer.  </p>
                <br>
            <p>OOutside of my professional ambitions, I am the father to a beautiful daughter, a 10 year old terrier named Maggie, 
                a golden retriever named Booker and an angry cat named Eddie. I live with the dogs, cat and my girlfriend, Marie in Old North Columbus. 
                We enjoy biking and dining at different restaurants in the greater Columbus area. One of my personal hobbies is retro game collecting, with a focus in Nintendo and Atari. 
                As a side note, I still own that old IBM PC that first sparked my love for programming.

        <p>Besides looking for a fun and exciting developer, you've probably been thinking to your self "I need to see some animal photos and I need to learn more about Maggie
            , Booker and Eddie. Well...  wait no further!

            <h3 class="headers">MAGGIE - THE TERROR OF TERRIERS</h3>
            <p>Maggie was my first born, so to speak.  She is  a Boston Terrier/Miniaure Schnauzer mix, or Mini-Boz for short. She turns 10 this September but still has the movement and energy of a puppy. In fact, I am fairly certain she will outlive Booker. For a small dog, she is very dominate of other dogs, even the large ones. She is the boss of the doggy day care and guards Booker. She was once put into detention for trying to fight a St. Bernard. I wish I was making this up.

            <p>If you had to put a picture of handsome in a dictionary, you could use the above photo. His good looks and charm has made it easier to get over our irritation and anger when he eats out of the litter box, eats food off the counter or just ignores simple commands of "come here!" or "Booker, stop!" He is a good boy... most of the time.

            <h3 class="headers">EDDIE (SPAGHETTI)</h3>
        
            <p>Eddie is old. He doesn't like other cats or the dogs. He seems to like people, which is a good thing. Eddie likes to eat frequently. We cannot give him a full bowl of food or he will vomit. Instead, we have to feed him small portions frequently and I f we forget to give him his 50th serving of dinner, things will start dropping off our tables and countertops.  Eddieâ€™s dining area is on top of the refrigerator where he also enjoys frequently staring at us in disgust.
