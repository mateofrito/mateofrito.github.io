            <a id="Bio"><h1>MATT FRY - THE STORY, SO FAR...</h1></a>
            
            <p>  Growing up in the cornfields of Champaign County, Ohio, I always had a faciscation with technology.  At a young age, I would always
                take apart electronics to see how they worked.  My first taste of programming was in the mid-90's when I was
                given an IBM AT PC after my cousin upgraded to a new laptop with the revolutionary Windows 3.1.  The computer had no games on it and  
                the monitor was capable of producing one color, green. My friend and I discovered it had the BASIC programming language installed and I taught myself how 
                to make simple programs.  It was after this, I decided I wanted to become a computer programmer and I attended DeVry University to 
                major in Computer Information Systems.  When I first attempted to learn Java, there were not many resources available and my professor was
                less than knowledgable in the subject matter, I grew frustrated and I changed majors to Business Information Systems and went into restaurant management.  
                During my time in restaurant management, I still had a love for technology and how things worked.  After years in the restaurant
                industry, I finally made the decision to make a career change and joined a top rated coding bootcamp, <a href="https://wecancodeit.org" target="_blank">We Can Code It</a>.</p>
                <br>
            <p> I am full-stack Java developer, my original frustration with Java has now grew into a love of learning more about it!  I am constantly researching and learning new technologies to make myself more valuable
                to make myself more valuable to any employer.  </p>
                <br>
            <p>Outside of my professional ambitions, I am the father to a beautiful daughter, a 10 year old
                terrier named Maggie, a golden retriever named Booker and an angry cat named Eddie.  I live with
                the dogs and cats and my girlfriend Marie in Old North Columbus.  We enjoy biking, dining at 
                different restaurants in Columbus.  My personal hobbies is retro game collecting, with a focus 
              in Nintendo and Atari.  As a side note, I still own that old IBM PC that first sparked my love for programming.

        <p>Besides looking for a fun and exciting developer, you've probably been thinking to your self "I need to see some animal photos and I need to learn more about Maggie
            , Booker and Eddie. Well...  wait no further!

            <h3 class="flexheaders">MAGGIE - THE TERROR OF TERRIERS</h3>
            <p>Maggie was my first born so to speak, she's a Boston Terrier/Miniaure Schnauzer mix, or Mini-Boz for short.  She turns 10 this September and still has the movement
                and energy of a puppy.  In fact, I am fairly certain she will outlive Booker. For a small dog she is very dominate of other dogs, even the large ones.  She is the 
                boss of the doggy day care and guards Booker.   She was once put into detention for trying to fight a St. Bernard.  I wish I was making this up, but I am not.

            <p>If you had to put a picture of handsome in a dictionary, you could use the above photo.  His good looks and charm has made it easier to get over our irritation and
                anger when he eats out of the litter box, eats food off the counter or just ignore simple commands of "come here!" or "booker, stop!"  He is a good boy... most of the time.

            <h3 class="flexheaders">EDDIE (SPAGHETTI)</h3>
        
            <p>Eddie is old. He doesn't like other cats or the dogs. He seems to like people, which is a good thing.  Eddie likes to eat frequently, we cannot give him a full bowl of food
                or he will vomit.  We have to feed him small portions frequently, if we forget to give him his 50th serving of dinner, things will start dropping off tables.  Eddie eats on 
            top of the refridgerator and frequently stares at us in disgust. </p>
