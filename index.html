            <p>  Growing up in the cornfields of Champaign County, Ohio, I always had a faciscation with technology.  I would always
                take apart electronics at a young age to see how they worked.  My first taste of programming was in the mid-90's when I was
                given an IBM AT PC after my cousing upgraded to a new laptop with the revolutionary Windows 3.1.  The computer had no games on it and  
                the monitor was capable of producing one color, green. My friend and I discovered it had the BASIC programming language installed and I taught myself how 
                to make simple programs.  It was after this, I decided I wanted to become a computer programmer and I attended DeVry University to 
                major in Computer Information Systems.  When I first attempted to learn Java, there were not many resources available and my professor was
                less than knowledgable in the subject matter, I grew frustrated and I changed majors to Business Information Systems and went into restaurant management.  
                During my time in restaurant management, I still had a love for technology and how things worked.  After years in the restaurant
                industry, I finally made the decision to make a career change and joined a top rated coding bootcamp, <a href="https://wecancodeit.org" target="_blank">We Can Code It</a>.</p>

                the dogs and cats and my girlfriend Marie in Old North Columbus.  We enjoy biking, dining at
